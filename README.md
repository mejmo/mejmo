I’m a backend engineer who loves building real systems—especially where AI meets healthcare. My comfort zone is JVM ecosystems, cloud-native architecture, and stitching together complex services that actually ship.

## 💼 What I Build

```
⚙️ JVM ecosystems: Java & Kotlin
🚀 Distributed systems & microservices with Spring Boot
☁️ Cloud-native platforms on AWS
📦 Containers & orchestration with Kubernetes
🧠 AI-powered backends and data pipelines
```
## 🤖 AI & Applied Intelligence

I’m actively building with modern AI stacks, with a strong interest in healthcare use cases (decision support, automation, data enrichment, clinical workflows):

```
🧠 LLMs (OpenAI, open-source models)
🔗 LangChain for orchestration
🧭 LangGraph for agentic workflows
📊 Vector databases & embeddings
🧪 Prompt engineering, RAG pipelines, and AI system design
🏥 Integrating AI into healthcare-adjacent systems responsibly<
```
## 🧠 Side Projects & Geekery

When I’m not working, I’m still building:

```
🛡️ Ethical hacking & security experiments
🏠 Smart home automation with Home Assistant
📡 Embedded systems & hardware tinkering: ESP32, Raspberry Pi
```
